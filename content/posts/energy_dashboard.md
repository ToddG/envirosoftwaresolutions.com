The Energy Dashboard, a part of the Energy Analytics Project, is a tool to help
de-carbonize the energy sector by providing easy access to publicly available
data. The Energy Dashboard transforms energy sector data from custom formats
into normalized Sqlite3 databases, with the goal of enabling data science and
research at a regional scale.
